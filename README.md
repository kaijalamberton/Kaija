## An Ode to my (eye opening) baby steps on the technological playground (and Nirvana)


Half ten   
I thought we’d start  


But I was wrong   
and late to class  


I’m doing this   
I hope I still pass  


*How deep is the link*  
*Between computing and art?*  


Reapproach   
what I’ve just asked  
ik moet het doen met *(een beetje)* vaart  

just as with   
a second thought   
I suppose it is fairly vast  


Coding,  
*to start it all*  


Is echt alleen maar  
*taal* and *taal*  


Maar Nederlands is het niet  
you don’t just find it on the street  

Eat me   
drink me  
Read me   
**file**  

It really has been a while
I’m the girl that's falling down
It's like a click bait rabbit hole

Github 
Markdown 
Good grief!
Charlie Brown

like Linus 
without blanket
I thought I’d drown

Arduino, or was it Raspberry Pi?
Last week they made Nirvana cry

This week   
I looked around   
Unsurprisingly, surprised by what I found  
Growing up as it simultaneously grew all around  
The games, films, screens and sounds    
Double dutch and monkey bars  
in the technological playground  


Spike and Sofia   
Zemeckis and gale  
It’s seems they weren’t so far off our tale

            '-----'
          
     
     
I’ve reapproached what I was asked  
And with this second thought I see   
it really is **creatively** vast
